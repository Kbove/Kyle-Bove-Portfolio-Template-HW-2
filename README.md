# Kyle's Portfolio HW 2

## Description

This is essentially a rough draft for my portfolio website that I will eventually build. It includes my name at the top in large font. Under that is my nav bar which allows users to quickly navigate to the various sections of the site. Under that a banner and a bio to talk a little bit about me. The meat of it is in the My Projects section to showcase all the different things I've built. Right now each of images is just a placeholder but I hope to fill it up with real projects. The headers and hav bar reorganizes into columns to better suit smaller screens.

#### User Story

Employers want to know what I'm bringing to the table so I've made it easy for them to see who I am and what I'm working on.
